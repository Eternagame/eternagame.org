            "abstract": "Prediction of RNA structure from sequence remains an unsolved problem, and progress has been slowed by a paucity of experimental data. Here, we present Ribonanza, a dataset of chemical mapping measurements on two million diverse RNA sequences collected through Eterna and other crowdsourced initiatives. The Ribonanza measurements enabled solicitation, training, and prospective evaluation of diverse deep neural networks through a Kaggle challenge, followed by distillation into a single, self-contained model called RibonanzaNet. When fine-tuned on previous datasets, RibonanzaNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling RNA chemical stability and RNA secondary structure. The latter enables three-dimensional structure modeling of RNA-only targets from the recent CASP trials with accuracy approaching human expert groups."

The first one (ISMB 2023) is based on local search and random walk which achieved the best published result on conditional probability on the Eterna100 benchmark, while the second one (arXiv preprint) casts RNA design as a continuous optimization problem and uses sampling to approximate the objective function and gradience calculation which achieved better results than the first paper in terms of conditional probability and ensemble defect, especially on long and hard-to-design puzzles."

This talk introduces RibonazaNet-Drop, a copy of RibonanzaNet fine-tuned for the pre-experimental prediction of data quality of individual sequences. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that stratifying the initial sequence library based on the predictions of RibonazaNet-Drop enhances the quality of chemical mapping data obtained."

These candidate sequences ranged in length from 21 to 229 nucleotides. The Pseudoknot Detective lab allowed 240 nucleotides per sequence, so a method was needed to 'pad' the candidates. This presentation describes a padding method optimized for least interaction with the pseudoknot structures."

This talk introduces a high-throughput chemical probing technology, highly selective for identifying RNA tertiary structure, called T-site probing.

However, the identification of undesignable structures has received little attention. Our algorithms efficiently prove the undesignability of certain structures or motifs by finding corresponding rival structures or motifs. By applying our algorithms to both Eterna puzzles and natural RNA structures, our undesignability results offer new insights into RNA folding and RNA design."
