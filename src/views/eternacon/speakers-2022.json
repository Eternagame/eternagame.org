            "abstract": "Therapeutics based on messenger RNA (mRNA) emerged as vaccine forerunners in the COVID-19 pandemic and show immense promise. However, the inherent chemical instability of RNA molecules sets a fundamental limit on the stability of mRNA vaccines, and has created barriers for equitable worldwide vaccine distribution. I  will talk about our efforts to develop a principled biophysical model for RNA degradation, and how we used this model to launch Eterna design challenges. Our studies indicated that the half-life of any mRNA can be immediately increased at least two-fold through sequence design. We further created a machine learning model, trained on degradation data from thousands of player-designed short RNA fragments, which revealed novel sequence- and structure-specific degradation patterns, and demonstrated improved predictive power in independent tests of experimentally-characterized mRNA half-lives. We anticipate this work will be formative for guiding future therapeutic and vaccine development in potency and stability.",

This is only the simplest level of 3D structure, stems and loops can fold into well defined shapes. We will take a look at some tertiary contacts and how they help RNA fold in 3D. We also will look at the ultimate 3D structure resource, the PDB, and highlight some key values that can help you assess the quality of structures.",
