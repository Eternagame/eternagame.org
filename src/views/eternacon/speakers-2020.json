In mimicry of regional-level RNA activity, we have designed a high-throughput, next generation sequencing-enabled tool for evaluating the basepairing availability of user-defined RNA regions of interest. In this talk, we will describe our application of these types of characterization tools (both cell free and intracellular) to rationally and modularly re-design RNAs for desired activity. We will further talk on preliminary efforts to expand our method-based platform to address longstanding challenges in the field, including therapeutic RNA optimization as well as recognition of long-range tertiary contacts."

            "abstract": "Engaging in research over the past year at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) has been a most satisfying experience. Our research focused on using bioinformatics databases to characterize novel genes. Most recently we were introduced to Eterna, which uses a novel gaming technique to expose students to RNA research. Our objective was to determine the challenges, if any, that PVAMU students face when they play Eterna.<br/><br/>We hypothesize that the gaming aspect of Eterna will present few challenges to PVAMU undergraduate students. Ten PVAMU students were introduced to Eterna in June 2020. Students were asked to discuss their Eterna experience over the past month. Now known as the PVAMU Etrna Lab Rats, all ten students have played the puzzles on the Eterna website and found the games to be fun and informative. However, a few challenges faced were (1) students’ lack of knowledge on certain vocabulary terms needed to play puzzles and (2) were unable to play the game on their mobile devices, and encountered problems within the chat box. In conclusion, 100% of the students have enjoyed their experience playing Eterna. They have advanced onto new levels, found entertainment maneuvering bases, and have enjoyed the support amongst experienced players within the game. However, our findings demonstrated that there are still opportunities to further enhance, develop, and improve the players performance. This can be achieved by implementing resources within the game. Our hypothesis suggests that improvements need to be established throughout the program in order to maximize our team performance.",

In this talk we will present cryo-EM structures of a mutant engineered ribosome, called P7A7, and the wild type E. coli ribosome. P7A7 carries 12 mutations in the active site, which have previously been shown to allow for incorporation of beta-amino acids into a protein chain in the cell. However, the structure shows these mutations act to severely disrupt the folding and assembly of the large subunit in vitro. This result suggests that new approaches will be needed to experiment with ribosomal function in a way that is less detrimental to its proper assembly. In part 2 of this talk, our recent high resolution structure of the wild type ribosome is presented to highlight what we can learn at 2 Å resolution.",

            "abstract": "In The Lonely Crowd (1950) sociologist David Riesman explores the three various types of social character present in society, their emotional motivations, and their interactions with media of communication.  Different from personality, social character refers to the social organization of preferences and goals within individuals, as well as their emotional drives.  Based on Riesman’s theoretical framework, I extend his insights to interpret participation in online citizen science video games generally and Eterna specifically.  I elaborate on two different forms of social character found within contemporary society: inner-directed character types and other-directed character types.  The Inner-directed type is drawn to activities as temporary withdrawals from the world, where the individual can find solitude.  Inner-directed types are motivated by goals based on permanent values, and they are more likely to engage in altruistic behavior such as engaging in citizen science.  Other-directed types are motivated by social cues taken from their peers, and when they retreat into video games, it is as an attempted escape from the pervasive anxiety they experience in contemporary society.  Other-directed types do not have goals based on permanent values, and they are less likely to commit to citizen science out of altruistic notions.  Based on the social character profiles of potential citizen scientists, I extend Riesman’s framework to offer suggestions for recruiting and retaining participants from the two types.",
